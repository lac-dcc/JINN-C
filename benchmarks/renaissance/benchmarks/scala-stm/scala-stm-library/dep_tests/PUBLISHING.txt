DEPLOYING THE SCALA-STM ARTIFACT

With a proper credentials file publishing a snapshot or release artifact is
accomplished with

  sbt +test (or bin/all_tests)
  sbt +publish

TESTING DEPLOYMENT AND ARTIFACT USAGE

To test using published artifacts via sbt, select the desired scala-stm
artifact in dep_tests/sbt/build.sbt .  Then

  cd dep_tests/sbt
  sbt +run

To test building using maven2, edit dep_tests/maven/pom.xml, then

  cd dep_tests/maven
  mvn -U compile
