BUILDING FROM SOURCE

scala-stm is built using sbt: http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/
Once you've installed sbt you can download scala-stm's compile dependency
(ScalaTest), build, and run the unit tests with

  sbt update test

You can get a list of sbt build targets with "sbt actions".  If you
compile, generate documentation or build a JAR, look in target/scala_* for
the results.  The Scala version is configured in project/build.properties.
The left-most value for "build.scala.versions" is the default.  To run
a build target for all of the versions prefix the action with a "+",
for example "sbt +test".
